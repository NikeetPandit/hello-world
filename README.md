# hello-world
Doing the github hello world tutorial. 
Branches - work with different versions of one repo (single organized project)
By defualt - repo has one branch named main which is the definite branch
We used branches to experiment and make edits before commiting to main...
When you create a branch of main - you make a snapshot of main as it was at that point in time ... 
If someone else made changes to main while yr working with yr branch, you could pull those updates...

Branches accomplish similar version control goals in GitHub repos as V1.txt V2.txt ect. files 
- use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work seperate from main (production) branch... when change is ready it gets merged

I am now commiting some changes! The purpose of this commit is see what a commit does and update the readme!
